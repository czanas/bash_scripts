#Overview
This repository is a collection of scripts and commands I find useful. 
If a scripts grows in complexity and/or usefulness, it will be moved to its own repository.

#Disclaimer
All scripts here are provided as-is. If you somehow came upon this page, make sure you know what a script is doing
before you use it.
